## 🔴 Backup Your Data First!

Before installing this version, **backup your existing** `sbitx/data` **and** `sbitx/web` **folders** to a safe location. This ensures you don’t lose important data such as your logbook, hardware calibration, and user settings.

### Backup Methods

#### 1️⃣ sBITX EZ Data (Recommended)

A built-in backup utility for both the factory and 64-bit versions of sBitx. This tool copies your critical data files to a USB drive. It can be installed from the sBitx Toolbox.

#### 2️⃣ Manual Backup

Alternatively, you can manually back up your data using the terminal:

```console
cd $HOME && mv sbitx sbitx_orig
```

To restore your backup after installation:

```console
cd $HOME && cp -r sbitx_orig/web/*.mc sbitx/web/ && cp -r sbitx_orig/data/* sbitx/data/
```
